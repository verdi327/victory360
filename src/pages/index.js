        Iâ€™m a veteran and a small business owner.  Iâ€™m also a Maryland native.  I grew up in Baltimore County.  I went to school at McDaniel College and for the last 25 years Iâ€™ve been running marketing campaigns for businesses - focusing on direct mail and non profit fundraising. 
      </p>

      <p>I like it here.</p>

      <p>
        I like my neighbors, my employees and the clients I get to work with.  But, like most Marylanders, I think we can do better.  While I believe each individual should be the change they wish to see, I think some problems have to be addressed at the political level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m no politician and Iâ€™m not well versed in politics, but what I do know is marketing.  I know that to connect with someone, you actually need to know something about them.

      <Blockquote>
        Marketing campaigns fail when companies sound too generic; trying to be everything to everyone.  To a consumer, it seems inauthenticate.

      <p>
        What I'm saying isnâ€™t news to you.  You know this, but up until now, you didnâ€™t know it possible to connect with your constituents in a personalized way that is both cost effective and scalable.  Leading brands tailor their marketing based off hundreds of data points on a given individual, political campaigns should be doing the same. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, many are not and weâ€™re still stuck in the age of the one-size-fits-all, spray and pray campaigns that hope if you can just get your name in front of someone enough times they might remember you at the polls. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I know we can do better and I started Victory360 specifically to help the right candidate win.

      <h3>Whatâ€™s the value of a single vote?</h3>

      <p>
        Consider the recent Democratic primary for Baltimore County Executive.  Johnny Olszewski won the bid by 17 votes, a margin of less than 0.1 percent.  As races become closer, it will be candidates that are able to connect with their voters that win, not those with the largest budgets.
